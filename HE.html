            <UL>
              <li>Due to the radioactive radiations, genetic mutations occur. These mutations damage the DNA strands and over time lead to the genetic disintegration</li>
              <li>Small doses of radiation can cause diseases that are not as severe and grow over time, whereas exposure to large amounts of radiation causes chronic diseases, cancer, or even sudden death in rare cases of acute contamination. </li>
              <li>In the United States, radon exposure is the second leading cause of lung cancer</li>
              <li> In addition, exposure to other radioactive materials can cause neurological, reproductive, or cardiovascular problems. Cancer may or may not develop as a result of these</li>
              <li> If the parents are exposed to radiation before or during pregnancy, the foetus may develop genetic birth defects and retardation</li>
              <li>The soil between Charava and Neendakara in coastal Kerala contains monazite, which contains the radioactive element thorium</li>
              <li> As a result, the amount of terrestrial radiation in this region is extremely high, ranging from 1500 to 3000 milliroentgens (mr) per year. The scientists speculate that the radiation accelerates the aging of egg cells and causes primary trisomy causing down syndrome in the babies.            </li>

Carnivores such as lions and vultures consume them, raising their radiation levels â€“ as demonstrated by the principle of Biomagnification.</li>
