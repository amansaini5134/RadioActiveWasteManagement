            <p>
                 When Japan decided not to surrender in world war II, America's president decided to
                 bomb the military bases of japan "HIROSHIMA and NAGASAKI". The main reasons for
                  deploying the world's first atomic bomb were ----they wanted to bring the war to a 
                  quick end and get into the dominant position. On the morning of August 6th 1945, a
                   plane named "ENOLA GAY" drove over the skies of Hiroshima with pilot Paul Tibbets and 
                   dropped the bomb called "LITTLE BOY" at 8:15 am. They decided to drop the "LITTLE BOY" 
                   bomb over an Aioi bridge but from wind deflection, it fell over the Chiva surgical clinic, 
                   approximately 250m away from the targeted place. 
                     In just 47 seconds, it covered a distance of 30,905 feet and had caused massive 
                destruction engulfing about 1,70,000 people within 1-2 weeks. When this news  was 
                heard by the president, he gave a speech on the radio that they have successfully 
                caused havoc in Hiroshima and shortly would get the world's leadership in their hands.
                 Only after three days, they had come up with a new TNT bomb which is even more
                 devastating than the "LITTLE BOY" named "FAT MAN" over the peaceful land of Nagasaki. 
                 At 11:02 am, the BOCKSCAR plane with the pilot Charles Sweeney dropped the bomb that 
                 hit the KOKURA city within 53 seconds and made Nagasaki the real version of hell that
                  took the lives of 80,000 innocent  people.</p>

            <p>
                1) Hiroshima, a manufacturing center of some 350,000 people tracked down about 500 miles 
                from Tokyo, was appointed as the first target. After arriving at the U.S. base on the 
                Pacific island of Tinian, the more than 9,000-pound uranium-235 bomb was loaded aboard a
                 modified B-29 bomber christened Enola Gay. The plane plummeted the bomb—known as “Little
                  Boy”—by parachute at 8:15 in the morning, and it detonated 2,000 feet above Hiroshima in 
                  a blast equal to 12-15,000 tons of TNT, engulfing five square miles of the city.
            </p>

            <p> 
                2) Hiroshima’s devastation failed to elicit immediate Japanese surrender, however, and on 
                 August 9 Major Charles Sweeney flew another B-29 bomber, BOCKSCAR from Tinian. Thick
                 clouds over the primary target, the city of Kokura, drove Sweeney to a secondary target, 
                 Nagasaki, where the plutonium bomb “Fat Man” was dropped at 11:02 that morning. More 
                 influential than the one used at Hiroshima, the bomb entertained nearly 10,000 pounds
                  and was designed to generate a 22-kiloton blast. The topography of Nagasaki, which was
                   nestled in narrow valleys between mountains, subtracted the bomb’s effect, limiting the 
                   wreckage to 2.6 square miles

            <h1>:: What happened after the event</h1>
            <p>
             1)  At noon on August 15, 1945 (Japanese time), Emperor Hirohito proclaimed his country's surrender in a 
                radio broadcast. The news spread rapidly, and 'Victory in Japan' celebrations flared out across the United
                 States and other Allied nations. The formal surrender agreement signed on September 2, 
                 aboard the U.S. battleship Missouri, anchored in Tokyo Bay.</p>

                 <p>2) Because of the degree of the havoc and chaos—including the fact that much of the 
                     two cities infrastructure wiped out—exact cessation tolls from the bombing of Hiroshima
                      and Nagasaki remain unknown. However, it is estimated to be 70,000 to 135,000 people
                       vanished in Hiroshima and 60,000 to 80,000 people withered in Nagasaki, Both from
                        acute exposure to the blasts and long-term consequences of radiation.

            <p>when that event happens, the people don't even get the chance to left flabbergasted as 
                it was so unexpected. People who got into the hands of this devastating havoc have been

                the younger generation. Some of the effect are as follow:-

             <ul>

                <li>There was a shortage of food supplements as the land got intoxicated by the radioactive explosion.</li>
                <li>The explosion was very harsh that their eyes, eardrum, lungs got severely damaged.</li> 
                <li>Their skin got fire burns that cause their death inevitable.</li>
                <li>Their shadows got imprinted on the ground due to the radiation like a printer</li>
