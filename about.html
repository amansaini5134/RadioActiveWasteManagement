        <p>Radioactive waste, an X-Risk  (or Existential risk)  has lately been posing a threat to
             humans and nature. The waste remains hazardous for thousands of years after it is no 
             longer commercially useful. The disposal of this waste is a major challenge due to its
              harmful effects. 
            But what actually is radioactive waste? How is it produced? What are the hazards
             associated with it? And how to manage it? Are some of the problems addressed here.</p>
